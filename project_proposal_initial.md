**Description:**
This work will involve the analysis of data of professional tennis players matches over the period in order to understand patterns. In the context of the analysis, to describe the parameters contributing to players’ outcomes, such are serve accuracy, returns, unforced errors among others, will be used. By examining data from both ATP and WTA matches, the project will answer questions like: Which match statistics are the most important in terms of forecasting a player’s chances of a win? What kind of performance difference is there between high ranked and low ranked players? What has changed in player performance over the course of the last ten years?

**Intellectual Merit:**
The quantitative aspects of tennis player performance will be better understood through this project. Knowledge about successful players’ specific trends and patterns of performance could provide insights that help to tell apart elite players from others. This analysis can assist athletes, coaches and analysts by optimizing their training and match strategies

**Data Sourcing:**
The first type of data will be collected from ATP and WTA websites, which contain information about matches, including aces, double faults, first serve percent, and break points won. More information can be derived from Tennis Abstract providing match histories and statistics to serve as reference. This dataset will be analyzed with the help of Python language.
