Description:
This project analyzes professional tennis match data to understand and predict match outcomes based on tournament and player characteristics. The analysis focuses on key parameters including tournament series, court conditions (indoor/outdoor), surface types (clay, grass, etc.), player rankings, and betting odds. By examining these multiple dimensions of ATP tour matches, the project aims to uncover patterns that influence match results and develop predictive insights into tennis match outcomes. The analysis will leverage comprehensive match data including tournament rounds, player points, and final scores to build a complete picture of competitive dynamics.

Research Questions:
1.	RO1: What are the significant predictors of match outcomes, given factors like player ranking and court surface?
2.	RO2: How do match statistics vary between higher-ranked and lower-ranked players?
3.	RO3: Does court surface affect the likelihood of a win for particular player profiles?
4.	RO4: How do betting odds correlate with actual match outcomes, and what does this reveal about prediction accuracy?

Intellectual Merit:
This project has the potential to reveal valuable insights into professional tennis by identifying key performance indicators that affect match outcomes. Through data analysis, the project will contribute to understanding how specific conditions (such as player ranking, court surface, and betting odds) play a role in shaping match results. This work can also provide a foundation for more extensive predictive modeling in sports analytics.

Data Sourcing:
The analysis utilizes a comprehensive tennis match dataset containing the following key information:
•	Tournament details: Series, Date, Court type (Indoor/Outdoor), Surface type, Round
•	Player information: Rankings, Points, Player names
•	Match specifics: Best of format, Winner, Final score
•	Betting market data: Match odds for both players
The dataset provides a rich view of professional tennis matches across various tournament conditions and competitive levels, enabling robust analysis of factors influencing match outcomes.
